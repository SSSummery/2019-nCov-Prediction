# IMPMD: An integrated method for predicting potential associations between miRNAs and diseases

## Requirements
* Matlab2017a

## File description
* There are four .m file in master. 
* myFitCal.m define the fitness funtion of two periods described in our paper for PSO. 
* mypso.m is the code for pso algorithm, it use the fitness function defined in myFitCal, please pay attention to change the size of your variables during different periods in oder to replay our results.
* visualization.m is built in order to make readers see the optimal results generated by PSO.
* differentalpha.m is built to show the prediction trends under different alpha.
* For more details, you are supposed to read the note at the beginning of each code file.

## Results
The ROC curves of different algorithm based on 10-fold cross validation. (A) the ROC curves of SVM. (B) the ROC curves of KNN. (C) the ROC curves of LR. (D) the ROC curves of comprehensive predictor.

Performance measures of the predictors trained by different algorithm. Four different algorithms are used to build models, namely SVM, KNN, LR and comprehensive algorithm, respectively.

Computational flow chart of miRNA functional similarity. Step 1, find out the diseases set (diseases associated with miRNA r_i and diseases associated with miRNA r_j, respectively). Step 2, calculate the semantic similarity between each disease in one disease set and each disease in another disease set. Step 3, find out the max semantic similarity for every disease. Step 4, calculate the functional similarity.

The disease DAGs of Cerebral Infarction and Alzheimer Disease. (A) The addresses of Cerebral Infarction and its ancestor nodes. (B) The addresses of Alzheimer Disease and its ancestor nodes. The nodes with bold black font represent the common nodes of the two DAGs.
