# IMPMD: An integrated method for predicting potential associations between miRNAs and diseases

## Requirements
* Matlab2017a

## File description
* There are four .m file in master. 
* myFitCal.m define the fitness funtion of two periods described in our paper for PSO. 
* mypso.m is the code for pso algorithm, it use the fitness function defined in myFitCal, please pay attention to change the size of your variables during different periods in oder to replay our results.
* visualization.m is built in order to make readers see the optimal results generated by PSO.
* differentalpha.m is built to show the prediction trends under different alpha.
* For more details, you are supposed to read the note at the beginning of each code file.

## Algorithm flow
In this article, we take Italy which is now experiencing severe situation of 2019-nCov as example to conduct analysis with the aim of offering utilizable suggestion. In the first period (before March 9, 2020), we attempt to inverse the virus spread timeline in Italy and the early period average spreading velocity by adopting PSO to optimize the parameters based on our SEIJR model and existing data (World Health Organization, 2020a). In the second period (only use data from March 9-16, 2020), we optimize the average spreading velocity in order to show the effect of country blockade. In the last period of our research, we demonstrate latent trends of confirmed cases with various average spreading velocity which of vital importance in controlling the disease. The whole flow chart is shown below.

## Results

### The first period
Adopting Visualization.m, you can get this result.

### The second period
Using mypso.m with fitness function for period first, you can get the result.

Fixed the parameter you obtained previously, then adopt them for period second, you will get the result.

Based the parameter you obtained previously, then change the size of parameter of mypso.m, you can get the average spread velocity during the period second, the prediction and actual value is shown as follow.

### different alpha
Using differentalpha.m, you can easily catch up the enfluence decided by the average spreadind velocity which is shown below.
